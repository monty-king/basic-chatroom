# MultiRoom Chat
This is a "game" where there are multiple chatrooms.  Each room has different functionality where you can do different things.  

See the SOW file for an idea of implementation

To start the chatroom:
1. Run 'python3 server.py' to start the server.
2. Run 'python3 client.py 0.0.0.0 31337' to connect a client.
3. Enter a username either in the second step or now.
4. Now you can chat.
