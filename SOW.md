# Project Title
Multi purpose Chat Room

# Team
Fynn Crossland & Monty King

# Objective
A server where a user can join and switch to different rooms, each with a different theme.  The base project is simply switching rooms where different conversations happen in each room.  

# Scope
Multi-user connections to server with no saved state.  Meaning, there is no history of chat logs, kind of like a party in real life.  You arrive at the party, you don't necessarily know what happened beforehand without someone telling you.  

# Deliverables
The completed project will be a working Python script that would run the chat room. There will also be updates made to account for any changes in the game's plan to encompass all that was completed or not for the project.
